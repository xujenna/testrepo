[MUSIC] This week,
we're going to be doing a little brain excavation to learn that focusing
intently isn't always the best thing for optimal learning and mind shifting. We'll discover other valuable
methods to enhance your learning. And we'll see some unbelievable
feats people can accomplish using these techniques. We'll also warn you about popular learning
approaches that research has shown are actually harmful. Perhaps most importantly, we'll give
you tools to help slip past your inner procrastinator and other proven tools
to help you reframe and reduce stress. All this and
more in this week's Mindshift. [MUSIC]
