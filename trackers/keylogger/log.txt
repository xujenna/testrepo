that would take so much processing power lol 
2018-02-07T12:07:53.140781
i mean, i think recording reactions is a good idea. it what would make this interesting is that we're sours have both sides of the story

this is just åi think it's good for our puiown information

soh sorry i'm taalking about the our thing again 
2018-02-07T12:11:17.815038
i don't really care about the assignment, we should just collect data that's guhelpful for us 
2018-02-07T12:11:45.248678
  so like , any reactions  emotional generally 
2018-02-07T12:13:38.747508
we can just keep a log of detailed reactions, and then categorize them afterwards to visualize 
2018-02-07T12:13:58.059099

At least for the more recent daset of photos. One thing that's immediately obvious is that : I photographed way fewer a much less diverse set of toΩΩ"concepts" in 2014 than I did in 2017. 
2018-02-22T13:33:30.424302
Another stricking observation  I also took much less photos.fewer ∑    is that "no person" is byfar the most common concept of 2014, while in the  photoset2017"people" is the _literally the opposite_the most common for 2017.

ç∑here's more info: √ about buying the passes  atat the station 
2018-02-25T15:27:42.248140
the important part is just that you can only bike for 30 min at a time, or else you pay extra 
2018-02-25T15:28:00.823784
so just keep and eye on the time, and swap bikes when you nnear 30 min 
2018-02-25T15:28:25.775316
it's not so mbad because there are stations everywhere
