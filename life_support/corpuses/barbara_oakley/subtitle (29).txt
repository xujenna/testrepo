[SOUND]. This week, we're going to be talking about
chunks, compact packages of information that your mind can
easily access. We'll talk about how you can form chunks,
how you can use them to improve your understanding of, and creativity with the
material, and how chunks can help you do better on
tests. We'll also talk about illusions of
competence in learning. This was when you're using ineffective
study methods that fool your mind into thinking you're learning something
when you're mostly just wasting your time. We'll cover what those less effective
study methods are and tell you what methods research has shown will work
better to help you in your studies. Finally we'll talk about something called
overlearning, which can solidly ingrain information in your
mind, but also can be a little like digging deeper ruts as you might spin your wheels
ineffectively in learning. You can make your study time more valuable by interleaving, providing intelligent
variety in your studies. I'm Barbara Oakley. Thanks for learning how to learn.
