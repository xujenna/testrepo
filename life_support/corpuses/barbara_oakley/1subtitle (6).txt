[MUSIC] What would you like research to tell you? Would you like it to say it's okay to
listen to music when you're studying? Or would you rather that research would
find that it's better not to listen to music when you're studying? Let's pause for a moment to take
a survey and see what you think. I have a little insight for you. Whatever you wanted that research to tell
you, whether it was to listen to music or not to listen to music, you can find
research that will back you up. Here's what we do know. If the music is fast and loud,
it disrupts reading comprehension, in part because you use
some of the same areas of the brain to process music as
you do to process language. Also, music with lyrics is more
distracting than music without lyrics. On the other hand, researchers have
found that if you're listening to a favorite style of music
it could enhance your studies. Or if it's something you
don't like it could detract. In the final analysis, all this means
that when it comes to music you should use commonsense and
discover what works best for you.
